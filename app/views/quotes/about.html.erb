  <h1>About Splurty</h1>

  <p>
    Splurty was built by <a target="_Anu" href="http://github.com/codingwollf">Anu</a>. Splurty is a random quote generator, and anyone can enter their own quote too. It's fantastic! Many of the quotes that Anu has entered are environmentally concsious. Be kind to the environment, and add your own favourite quotes as well. 
  </p>
 <br />
  <p> 
  	There are several quotes already added by Anu, the creator. Also, quotes that are shorter than 5 characters or longer than 240 characters are not valid to enter -- you can try it if you'd like! Thank you for visiting splurty!
